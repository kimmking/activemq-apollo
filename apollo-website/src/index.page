[ActiveMQ Apollo](http://activemq.apache.org/apollo/) is a faster, more
reliable, easier to maintain messaging broker built from the foundations of
the original [ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org). It accomplishes this
using a radically different threading and message dispatching 
[architecture](documentation/architecture.html).  Like ActiveMQ, Apollo is a 
multi-protocol broker and supports STOMP, AMQP, MQTT, Openwire, SSL, and WebSockets.
